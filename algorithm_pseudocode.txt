Pseudocode for each of the algorithms is provided:

Note that in these examples, calls to LED class methods such as swapPixel(), comparePixel(), compareAndSwapPixel(), and highlight() have been reduced to their basic functionality for the sake of clarity

For example highlight(x,y) would be represented by two lines:
	
-	highlight pixels on LED strip between x and y
-	update LED strip

or:
	
-	highlight pixel on LED strip at x
-	update LED strip

swapPixel(x, y) would be represented by one line:

-	swap pixels at x and y

comparePixel(x, y) would be represented by the following structure:

-	if pixel at x < pixel at y  then
-		# DO SOMETHING â€¦

compareAndSwapPixel(x, y) would be represented by the following:

-	If pixel at x < pixel at y then
-		swap pixels at x and y
